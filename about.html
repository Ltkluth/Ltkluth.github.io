      <h2>Why was the <i>Write a Nature Appreciation Note</i> website created?</h2>
    
      <p>Have you ever found peace by standing in nature? Has the color of leaves in the trees or flowers on the ground brought a smile to your face? Not only does nature provide the resources humans need to live, nature brings tranquility, awe, and joy to our lives. Nature has irreplaceable beauty. However, despite all the recognition that nature deserves, we often do not show appreciation. Instead, we harm nature. In the modern world, many of us no longer have a strong connection to nature. The loss of connection between humans and nature lowers our quality of life and reinforces our tendency to damage nature. By writing appreciation letters to nature, we can remind ourselves of all that nature has done for us, rebuild our connection with nature, and finally give nature the love it deserves.</p>

      <h2>About the creator of <i>Write a Nature Appreciation Note</i></h2>
        
      <p> Layla Kluth was born in 2007 in NYC and raised across the river in Jersey City. She loves STEM, spending time in nature, painting/drawing, writing, and running. Her love for nature began as a kid. Whenever she got a chance to be in a forest, or on a mountain meadow, she experienced incredible peace and beauty that would sometimes even bring her to tears. She spent many hours up in trees, or building shelters out of sticks. Layla's relationship with nature is one of the most important relationships in her life. Layla is disheartened by how humans treat nature; from destroying the woods for development to leaching chemicals into the soil and air. She hopes, for the sake of both humans and nature, that more people can experience a strong connection to nature.
