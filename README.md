The website advocates for humans to rebuild loving connections with nature

Have you ever found peace by standing in nature? Has the color of leaves in the trees or flowers on the ground brought a smile to your face? Not only does nature provide the resources humans need to live, nature brings tranquility, awe, and joy to our lives. Nature has irreplaceable beauty. However, despite all the recognition that nature deserves, we often do not show appreciation. Instead, we harm nature. In the modern world, many of us no longer have a strong connection to nature. The loss of connection between humans and nature lowers our quality of life and reinforces our tendency to damage nature. By writing appreciation letters to nature, we can remind ourselves of all that nature has done for us, rebuild our connection with nature, and finally give nature the love it deserves.
